# DevOps Project Management with JIRA

## Overview

This README provides an overview of the project management process for the DevOps team using JIRA as the primary tool. It outlines how tickets are created, managed, and prioritized, as well as the roles and ceremonies involved in the Agile development process.

## Ticket Workflow

- **Ticket Creation**: Other teams create tickets (bugs, stories, features) on the DevOps project in JIRA.
- **Backlog**: Created tickets go to the backlog.
- **Backlog Refinement**: Product Owner decides the effort and priority of each ticket during backlog refinement meetings.
- **Sprint Planning**: Tickets are selected for Sprint 1 (2-3 weeks) or Sprint 2 (5-6 weeks) based on priority and effort.
- **Capacity Planning**: Product Owner determines the capacity of each sprint (e.g., 25 points) and selects stories for Sprint 1 based on priority until capacity is reached.
- **Story Points**: Each story is assigned a point value (1 for easiest, up to 8 for hardest) by the Product Owner.

## Sprint Management

- **Main Goal**: Sprints can have a main goal, which guides the selection of tickets.
- **Active Sprint**: In the Active Sprint tab, each story is assigned to a team member and labeled with its current state (To Do, In Progress, Done).

## Ceremonies

- **Daily Stand-up**: Managed by the Scrum Master, a 15-minute daily meeting where team members discuss:
  - What did I work on yesterday?
  - What am I working on today?
  - What issues are blocking me? (e.g., permissions, setup)
  
- **Mid-Sprint Review**: A 30-minute meeting with the presence of the manager to review progress midway through the sprint.

## Roles

- **Scrum Master**: Optimizes the Scrum process and facilitates ceremonies.
- **Product Owner**: Defines the product vision and prioritizes requirements.
